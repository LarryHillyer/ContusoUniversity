These projects are for use with the tutorials shown in the included PDF.  Links to individual tutorials in the PDF point to the former locations of the tutorials on the ASP.NET site. These tutorials have been replaced on the ASP.NET site with a new version that uses LocalDB as the development database and Windows Azure as the destination production environment.

ContosoUniversity-Begin is the project to use if you are working through the tutorials from the beginning.
ContosoUniversity-After09 shows the state of the project after tutorial #9 (before the migration from SQL Server Compact to SQL Server)
ContosoUniversity-End shows the state of the project after tutorial #11 (after the migration to SQL Server in tutorial #10 and the database update in tutorial #11)
